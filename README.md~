RandomLinuxBashScripts
======================

A collection of random scripts I use a bunch on my xubuntu rig

Feel free to use them for whatever, but they're kinda focused on rather specific things.
Many of them will need editing before they'll work on your system.

xbc-start requires that you install xboxdrv, and is useless unless you have an xbox 360 controller. I have included a couple of schemes for the games I play most. Because of the already-installed-but-mostly-useless xpad module, you'll need supercow powers to use this. You can enter ./xbc-start \~ to use your xbox controller as a mouse.

The scripts in /apt-get will update your computer in a single command. ./update-all will do so recursively, until no more updates are found.

The stuff in /git is useful for updating your repositories quickly from the commandline. They will definately need to be edited first, and again for each repo you plan to use them in. They must be located in the root of your local repo.
